This project was created for the **Brainrot Jia SEED Hackathon**, under the category **"Would Piss Off People on LinkedIn."** The goal of this category was to create something that would mock and poke fun at LinkedIn culture.

## 🎯 Project Overview  
**LinkedOut** is a web application designed to humorously mimic LinkedIn’s most cringe-worthy aspects, such as absurd job posts, overly dramatic career horoscopes, and ridiculous hustle culture. The app offers users a sarcastic yet engaging way to interact with the platform’s satirical features.

### 🌟 Key Features  
1. **Horoscope Generator**:  
   - Users select traits from quirky categories like favorite pet, drink, and LinkedIn archetype, etc.  
   - Generates brutally sarcastic daily horoscopes mocking corporate and LinkedIn culture.  
   - Horoscopes can be shared to amplify the fun!  

2. **HR-HR Game: Absurd Job Posts**:  
   - Users act as an HR professional creating a snarky job post.  
   - Dynamic job descriptions are generated based on user inputs, highlighting corporate absurdities with humor and wit.  
   - Includes filters to add snarky comments and tags like "Skill Inflation."  

3. **Hustle Culture AI Trainer**:  
   - Asks users their "hustler level" (e.g., Fresher, 40-hour workweek, or 70-hour workweek).  
   - Generates sarcastic timetables mocking fake hustle culture.  
   - Examples include 4 AM wake-ups, posting cringe motivational quotes on LinkedIn, and absurd meeting schedules.

## 😅 Hackathon Experience  

Participating in the Brainrot Jia SEED Hackathon, **my first hackathon experience**,was an exhilarating journey filled with challenges and creativity. Here's what I experienced:  

- **Learning Curve**: Diving into React, integrating APIs, and creating a seamless frontend-backend connection was an incredible learning experience.  
- **Moments of Laughter**: Coming up with sarcastic responses and quirky content for the app made the entire process enjoyable.  
- **Collaboration with AI**: Leveraging AI APIs like Google Gemini made the project dynamic and creative, taking satire to another level.  
- **Problem Solving**: Facing deployment issues and solving backend challenges taught me the importance of persistence and debugging skills.  

The goal was to not only create a working project but also to deliver humor, creativity, and functionality—all while mocking LinkedIn culture.
